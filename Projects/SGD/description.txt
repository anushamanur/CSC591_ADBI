Stochastic Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression or with L2-regularization

Stochastic Gradient Descent

Your are tasked to implement one of the two functions below (in Python):

1) Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for the linear regression problem with L2-regularization

 or

2) SGD for the Logistic Regression problem

You should also include the Driver program and the Unite Test function that calls and tests your SGD function

    Submit a single zip folder called (First_LastName.zip). Include both ipynb Jupyter Notebook and HTML files of running the notebook along with any data set used to test the program.
