# Deep Neural Networks: Defect Segmentation on Textured Surfaces

## Description
Development of a model to detect defects by Industrial Optical Inspection on Textured Surfaces. This problem can be modelled as an Image
Segmentation task where you will have to find the pixels where the defect occurs in a given image. \

## Dataset used 
The dataset we will be using is described [here](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/3616)
